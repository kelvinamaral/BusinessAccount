# Java Bank Activity

This repository contains the implementation of an activity proposed during a Udemy course. The goal of the activity is to simulate a banking system with two types of accounts: Regular Account and Business Account.

## Problem Statement

The business scenario involves two types of bank accounts:

- **Regular Account**: A basic account with standard banking features.
- **Business Account**: Includes all the features of the regular account, with the addition of:
    - A loan limit.
    - An operation to take out loans.

The objective is to implement these functionalities in Java, ensuring proper class inheritance and method overriding where necessary.

## Key Concepts

This activity is designed to practice:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- Class inheritance in Java.
- Overriding methods to extend functionality.
- Handling specific features of specialized account types.

## About the Project

The project includes:

- A `RegularAccount` class with standard features.
- A `BusinessAccount` class extending the functionality of the `RegularAccount`, introducing loan features.
- Test cases to validate account operations and the loan feature.
